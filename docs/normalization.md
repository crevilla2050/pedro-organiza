Normalization in Pedro Organiza is a deterministic, lossy, read-only transformation used to generate comparison-friendly representations of metadata fields.

Normalized values are never used directly to modify files or overwrite user intent.

Normalization does not attempt to resolve aliases, infer meaning, or guess canonical names.

Normalization is stable across runs and versions unless explicitly versioned.
